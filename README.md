# Stock-trading Website
## This project was part of a course on Frontend Development, focused on creating a Trading application for both mobile and Web. This is the WEB version.

The project focuses on GUI and does not have a database. It is written in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. For one of the pages we are also using Bootstrap.
The Website consists of:
- A register page. This page checks for credentials that match a certain format, e.g. a correct mobile number and email, and then registers the user into Local storage in the browser.
- Login page
- Landing page
- Radar: a page that shows news and trending stocks.
- Dashboard: where you can see your current balance as well as favourite stocks.
- Pro

The website tries to load the yahoofinance API, and if that fails it reverts to mock-data.
It is live on Github pages: https://dariaccc.github.io/stockapp_web/

The project was made by:
- Soroush Bolbolabady
- Daria Carlberg
- Maria Berta Rodas Palomo
- Shresht Sanjay Prasad
